<p>Last February (has it been that long ago already?) the Wallstreet Journal <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-bets-on-bitcoin-ledger-1455598864" target="_blank">posted</a> that</p>
<blockquote><p>IBM is becoming the biggest backer of blockchain technology, and taking a leading role in the development of innovative, next generation blockchain applications beyond Bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>This quote was part of my recent presentation at the Guide Executive Council in Madrid, where I presented the blockchain concept (and the bitcoin implementation) to the attendees.</p>
<p>After giving the presentation and hearing the remarks (mostly positive I can assure you) of the audience the concept of blockchain in relation to The Mainframe really started sinking in to me.</p>
<p>As we all know The Mainframe can be equipped with a <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/security/cryptocards/pciecc2/pdf/SC33-8294-05-4.pdf" target="_blank">Crypto Express 2</a> card. A card well equipped for performing Elliptic Curve Cryptography as well as various hashing algorithms. And this got me thinking. It got me thinking a lot to be honest.....</p>
<p><strong>What if we would join (or start) a mining pool on z13's, Rockhoppers and Emperors?</strong></p>
<p>We would call it the zPool and have a bunch of Mainframes from all over the world join in. I truly believe that a couple of <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CNNvcGNUEAAGsVw.jpg" target="_blank">these machines</a> would totally outrun setups like <a href="http://www.joeydevilla.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bitcoin-fpga-mining-rig.jpg-.jpg" target="_blank">these</a>. They would most definitely be more quiet :)</p>
