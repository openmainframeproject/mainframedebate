<p>A backlog of legacy software applications has many state government agencies clinging to costly mainframe computers, despite growing pressure to shut them down, the National Association of State Technology Directors reports.</p>
<div class="paywall">
<p>Among other issues, a key concern is the growing loss of state workers who know how to operate these often aging tech tools -- whether they are being drawn to the private sector or simply retiring, the national trade group said.</p>
<p>“Difficulty retaining and hiring mainframe support staff, and increasing costs, are the primary drivers for states moving applications off mainframe platforms,” the group’s researchers said in a report analyzing the results of a survey of state information-technology officials nationwide.</p>
<p>The survey, conducted in conjunction with the National Association of State Chief Information Officers, included responses by IT officials in 38 states, including California, Georgia, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York and Texas.</p>
<p>Among these states, officials reported an average of 21.6 agencies using mainframe computers managed by a central IT department, with 11% reporting more than 30.</p>
<p>The types of agencies using mainframe computers typically included departments of motor vehicles, social services, finance, accounting, Medicaid eligibility and taxes, the report said.</p>
<p>Mainframes, which are large-capacity computers typically used by big corporations to handle data processing and administrative tasks, first appeared more than 50 years ago. As such, they are often seen as a relic of the digital age.</p>
<p>Yet many large private-sector firms continue to use mainframes for both internal and customer-facing applications, especially in the banking, insurance and health sectors.</p>
<p>International Business Machines Corp. in July<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ibm-stock-ticks-higher-as-mainframe-gains-fuel-earnings-beat-2018-07-18"> reported strong gains in its decades-old mainframe business</a>, which pushed second-quarter systems revenue 23% to $2.18 billion.</p>
<p>In an earnings call that month, James Kavanaugh, IBM’s chief financial officer, called mainframes the “most enduring platform that you’ve seen out there.”</p>
<p>The loss of skilled mainframe operators is not limited to the public sector. A study earlier this year by Forrester Research, conducted for Compuware Corp., found that enterprises that use mainframes have lost an average 23% of specialized mainframe staff over the last five years, while 63% of those positions remain unfilled.</p>

<p>Beyond a brain drain, managing these older systems is becoming problematic as state IT hubs face tighter budgets seeking to “maximize efficiencies while doing more with less,” according to state funding trends, researchers said.</p>
<div id="unruly" class="wsj-body-ad-placement"></div>
<p>Mainframe computers are generally more costly to operate, compared to the cloud or other on-demand services, with per-user costs rising as more agencies seek newer, cheaper alternatives, the report said.</p>
<p>The need to support legacy applications -- cited by 95% of state IT officials -- was a primary reason for retaining mainframe computing power.</p>
<p>On the upside, researchers found, most state IT officials do not expect agency demand for mainframe computing power to grow in the future. Many said they are already moving away from managing their own mainframes in-house, either by outsourcing all mainframe services to third-party managers or taking a hybrid approach with outside vendors.</p>
<p>Still, others said the use of mainframe computers is unlikely to be entirely phased out any time soon.</p>
<p>To cut costs, a handful of states are partnering together to share mainframe resources, wherever possible.</p>
<p>Some also are looking at adopting a mainframe-as-a-service by billing agencies based on consumption of mainframe resources.</p>
<p>These and other internal IT issues can have an impact on public services. A recent<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-cios-hit-limits-improving-online-services-study-finds-1535494119"> analysis of 400 state-government websites</a> offering online services such as driver’s license applications, tax payments or business registrations, found that 99% failed at least one basic performance measure.</p>
<p>The issues included slow page-load speeds, a lack of mobile tools and features or accessibility issues, among others, according to the Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation, a technology and public-policy think tank.</p>
