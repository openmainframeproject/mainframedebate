    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">DancingDinosaur
    wrote a long paper for an audience of x86 users. The premise of the paper: the
    z Systems in many cases could be a better and even lower cost alternative to x86
    for a private or hybrid cloud. The following is an excerpt from that paper.</p>\r\n<p
    style=\"text-align:left;\"> <a href=\"https://mainframedebate.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/cloud_computing_providers.jpg\"><img
    class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1852\" src=\"https://mainframedebate.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/cloud_computing_providers.jpg\"

    data-rehosted=\"1\"></a></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">BTW, IBM earlier
    this <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/46011.wss\">month
    announced it signed a 10-year, large-scale services agreement</a> with Shop Direct
    to move the multi-brand digital retailer to a hybrid cloud model to increase flexibility
    and quickly respond to changes in demand as it grows, one of many such IBM wins
    recently. The announcement never mentioned Shop Direct’s previous platform. But
    it or any company in a similar position could have opted to build its own hybrid
    (private/public) cloud platform.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A hybrid
    cloud a company builds today probably runs on the x86 platform and the Windows
    OS. Other x86-based clouds run Linux. As demand for the organization’s hybrid
    cloud grows and new capabilities are added traffic increases.  The conventional
    response is to scale out or scale up, adding more or faster x86 processors to
    handle more workloads for more users.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">So,
    why not opt for a hybrid cloud running on the z? As a platform, x86 is far from
    perfect; too unstable and insecure for starters. By adopting a zEC12 or a z13
    to host your hybrid cloud you get one of the fastest general commercial processors
    in the market and the highest security rating for commercial servers, (EAL 5+).
    But most x86-oriented data centers would balk. Way too expensive would be their
    initial reaction. Even if they took a moment to look at the numbers their IT staff
    would be in open revolt and give you every reason it couldn’t work.</p>\r\n<p
    style=\"text-align:left;\">The x86 platform, however, is not nearly as inexpensive
    as it was believed, and there are many ways to make the z cost competitive. Due
    to the eccentricities of Oracle licensing on the z Systems, for instance, organizations
    often can justify the entire cost of the mainframe just from the annual Oracle
    software license savings. This can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars
    or more each year. And the entry level mainframe has a list price of $75,000,
    not much more than an x86 system of comparable MIPS. And that’s before you start
    calculating the cost of x86 redundancy, failover, and zero downtime that comes
    built into the mainframe or consider security. Plus with the z Systems Solution
    Edition program, IBM is almost giving the mainframe away for free.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Some
    x86 shops could think of the mainframe as a potent Linux machine that can handle
    thousands of Linux instances without breaking a sweat. The staff wouldn't even
    have to touch z/OS. It also runs Java and Hadoop. And it delivers an astonishingly
    fast and efficient Linux environment that provides a level of performance that
    would require a much great number of x86 cores to try to match. And if you want
    to host an on-premises or hybrid cloud at enterprise scale it takes a lot of cores.
    The cost of acquiring all those x86 cores, deploying them, and managing them will
    break almost any budget.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Just ask Jim Tussing,
    Chief Technology Officer for infrastructure and operations at <a href=\"http://www.ndm.net/datawarehouse/IBM/nationwide-cuts-costs-in-the-cloud-case-study\">Nationwide
    Insurance</a> (DancingDinosaur has covered Tussing before): “We had literally
    3000 x86 servers deployed that were underutilized,” which is common in the x86
    environment even with VMware or Hyper-V virtualization. At a time when Nationwide
    was seeking to increase the pace of innovation across its products and channels,
    but rolling out new environments were taking weeks or months to provision and
    deploy, again not unheard of in the x86 world. The x86 environment at Nationwide
    was choking the company.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">So, Nationwide consolidated
    and virtualized as many x86 servers on a mainframe as possible, creating what
    amounted to an on-premises and hybrid cloud. The payoff: Nationwide reduced power,
    cooling, and floor space requirements by 80 percent. And it finally reversed the
    spiraling expenditure on its distributed server landscape, saving an estimated
    $15 million over the first three years, money it could redirect into innovation
    and new products. It also could provision new virtual server instances fast and
    tap the hybrid cloud for new capabilities.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">None
    of this should be news to readers of DancingDinosaur. However some mainframe shops
    still face organizational resistance to mainframe computing. Hope this might help
    reinforce the z case.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">DancingDinsosaur is
