<p>Attendees gave the event an overall average satisfaction rating of 97%</p>

<p><strong>New Webinar Series kicking off with Zowe!</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We are pleased to announce a new monthly webinar series to showcase the great technical collaboration happening within the Open Mainframe Project and our hosted communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The first webinar will be held on October 14, 2020 at 11:30am US Eastern Time, and with the first of many quarterly updates on Zowe. The agenda will be both a brief update on Zowe, along with a focus topic on learning how developers are extending the Zowe ZSS (z/OS back-end) to facilitate building in-depth (cross-memory, privileged, system-level) mainframe products with little-to-no assembler code required.
