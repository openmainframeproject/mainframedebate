<p>Mobile, The Millennial and The Mainframe</p>
<p>I recently took a quiz online that asked ‘How Millennial Are You?’* From the 15 questions I answered I received a score of 94/100- so I would say that makes me ‘very millennial’ (the mark of a millennial was a score of 73 or higher…) But what does being a millennial actually mean? Well, according to this quiz, it meant I’ve watched some TV, haven’t read a ‘physical’ newspaper in some time, have a social networking presence, and, most importantly, spend a hideous amount of time on my mobile phone. In fact, I only have a mobile phone- I haven’t had a landline since I left my parent’s home eight years ago. On that mobile phone I receive, on average, over 50 text messages a day, I check my bank balance regularly (surely some money will have magically appeared?!), update my social media and do my shopping- everything from a weekly food shop to Christmas gifts. I recently even sold my laptop, I didn’t use it, I could do everything I needed from the little white oblong in my hand, with the Disney Castle wallpaper (no judgement).</p>
<p>According to <em>‘Millennial Week’</em> there are 1.8 billion millennials worldwide. That’s 1.8 billion of us checking our phones on average 30 times per hour, which in turn generates millions of new transactions for companies’ infrastructure to handle. More so, these transactions are often ‘read only’, for example my constant checking of my bank balance- my bank sees no additional revenue from this, however their systems must be able to cope with the increase in traffic (something IBM has combatted with Mobile Workload Pricing). z Systems are able to handle 30 billion transactions a day- not even I need to check my balance that often. Additionally , with VISA recently stating they had not had a second of planned or unplanned downtime in 20-years, z offers the uninterrupted level of service millennials expect,.</p>
<p>So what’s in it for companies? Who cares if I can’t Instagram that picture of my sandwich? So what if I can’t check my bank balance every 2-minutes? Well, according to a report by Javelin Strategy and Research, 90 percent of people who switched their bank cited poor mobile capabilities as the main reason. Additionally, companies can, and should, use these ‘nothing’ transactions to power customer insight and drive revenue. I’d say that was pretty important. Even better, when running the IBM MobileFirst platform on z13 versus x86 blades, companies stand to save 37% per transaction with a 36% lower response time.</p>
<p>How many times have you received the following: “Dear Sir/Madam”, “Dear Customer”, or the most heinous, “Dear <em>Insert Name Here</em>” followed by a generic email about the latest and greatest (and, let’s face it, irrelevant) offerings? I know I have. Running mobile and analytics on the mainframe can put a stop to this blanket approach and focus in on the ‘Demographic of One’. By housing the System of Engagement (the mobile environment) on the same platform that holds your System of Record (i.e. customer data, accounting, order fulfilment etc. on the mainframe) a company can apply real time analytics to their mobile transactions in order to personalise their service to their customers. In the example of my banking, by using mobile analytics my bank will be able to tailor offers to me and address me accordingly (“Miss Wright, we see you have no money- perhaps a loan?”)</p>
<p>In today’s world mobile is everyone’s business. A Mobile Moment can define how a customer views your brand; it can help attract customers, retain new ones, put simply, grow your business. The mobile is the point at which your customer engages with a brand- and companies have to be there to deliver. Now, excuse me - I’m off to take a selfie.</p>

<p>Editors Note - Lucy Wright is a millennial mainframer based in the UK, and can be found on Twitter @lucefluce - if she takes more than a couple of minutes to reply to your tweet, based on the evidence of her post above, I would take it personally...</p>
