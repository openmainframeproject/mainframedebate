<p>As the high speed train that is LinuxONE continues to roll (sorry it had to be done), great to see another client reference coming out today from a Chinese client, the catchily titled Nanchong Dandai Transport Industry Group.  From what we can glean from the <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/49541.wss">press release</a> it appears that the LinuxONE system will provide the foundation for a new mobile app that will service travelers in 64 towns and cities and provide them with a compelling way to purchase tickets, whilst also providing Dandai with some very valuable client insight.</p>
<p>Expect to see more of these types of wins from IBM as clients increasingly see Linux as mission critical and therefore demand; higher availability, performance, scale and security from the underlying platform that supports their deployment.</p>
