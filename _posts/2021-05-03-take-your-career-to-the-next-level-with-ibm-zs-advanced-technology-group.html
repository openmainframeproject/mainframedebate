<p>“Why do I want to work for IBM?” and “Why do I want to work on the mainframe?”  I could never have imagined that the answers that I gave during my initial IBM interview in 1981, would still resonate today! </p>

<p>IBM is a world-class Fortune 500 company with impressive, cutting-edge technology and an even more impressive workforce of highly talented IBMers – the bedrock of our company!&nbsp;&nbsp;IBM Z mainframes run the world’s most important workloads from Wall Street to Walmart!&nbsp;&nbsp;Both IBM and the mainframe have reinvented countless times and continue to evolve and modernize to solve our clients’ and the world’s most challenging problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I never imagined that my IBM Z career (back then it was called IBM System/370), which started running Virtual Machine (VM) High Performance Option (HPO) workload simulations and performance benchmarks on IBM’s largest mainframe computers, as I worked on the graveyard shift from midnight to 8am in Poughkeepsie, New York, would span such a wide range of mainframe related opportunities during my four-decade career.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I’ve continued to reinvent myself with new skills and career experiences, to align with the mainframe and IBM’s cognitive, hybrid cloud transformation.&nbsp;&nbsp;From development programming to sales to technical consulting to management to new Summit employee training/enablement, and now with my current IBM Z technical sales leadership role.&nbsp;&nbsp;With IBM and IBM Z mainframes, the career possibilities are endless!&nbsp;&nbsp;This was true back in 1981 when I started my mainframe career and remains true today!&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>IBM Z and LinuxONE continue to be the most secure, resilient, highest-performing, and most cost-effective enterprise servers on the planet!&nbsp;&nbsp;The perfect enterprise platform for mission-critical applications in today’s hybrid cloud environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;IBM Z opens doors and is the foundation of computing across the world!&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>At IBM, work is more than a career – it’s a calling:&nbsp;&nbsp;To build.&nbsp;&nbsp;To design.&nbsp;&nbsp;To code.&nbsp;&nbsp;To consult.&nbsp;&nbsp;To think along with clients and sell.&nbsp;&nbsp;To make markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;To invent.&nbsp;&nbsp;To collaborate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just to do something better, but to attempt things no one’s ever thought possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;To lead in this new era of technology and solve some of the world’s most challenging problems.</p>
