<p>Every second of every day, businesses exchange value with suppliers, partners, customers and others. By value, we mean goods, services, money, data and more. Each exchange of value is a transaction. Successful transactions need to be fast, precise and easily agreed on by parties participating in the transaction.</p>
<p>Blockchain for business provides a way to execute many more of these transactions — a much better way.</p>
<p>Over the past year interest around the application of Blockchain across industries has exploded. Many organizations are now exploring different blockchain platforms for enterprise private permissioned networks. But, Blockchain has security challenges that can exploited through vulnerabilities in the infrastructure. Organizations will need a platform that is secure with advanced encryption features in both hardware and software to keep customer data safe.</p>
