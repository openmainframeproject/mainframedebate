<p>It is November, and as I sit on my desk to write this blog, I see the beautiful colors of autumn through my window. The technology that is available for us today reminds me of one of Jim Bishop’s quotes: “Autumn carries more gold in its pocket than all the other seasons.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is the season to talk about great technology powered by open-source innovation and available to you in integrated and easy-to-deploy packages.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>First, let’s start with the announcement of the general availability of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openshift.com/blog/red-hat-openshift-4.6-is-now-available">Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.6</a>. In a nutshell, OpenShift is an enterprise Kubernetes-based platform to run and manage containerized applications. It is designed to augment Kubernetes with features that include automatic software updates and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), container lifecycle management across hybrid multi-cloud environments, and it is built on the trusted foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS. OpenShift is based on open-source software including many to which IBM and Red Hat regularly contribute upstream, from Linux to Kubernetes, Ansible, and many others. Additionally, it includes developer tools, a registry, and security scan capabilities.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/release_notes/ocp-4-6-release-notes.html#ocp-4-6-ibm-z">OpenShift version 4.6</a>&nbsp;is the first release delivered at the same time across all platform architectures, including IBM Z and LinuxONE.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now let’s talk about how they all fit together for IBM Z and LinuxONE. We have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-applications">IBM Cloud Paks</a>;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you haven’t looked at them, I highly recommend them. IBM Cloud Paks containerize key IBM and open-source software components to enable faster enterprise application development and delivery. Do you recognize a pattern by now? Open-source integrated, tested, packaged, and supported for you. As I like to say, we are in the business of making life easier for developers as well as speeding up software development/operation. For that, we have OpenShift and Cloud Paks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With Cloud Paks deployed on top of OpenShift on IBM Z and LinuxONE, we offer the best software infrastructure to build and operate cloud-native software. It goes without saying that users of these offerings also enjoy all the benefits of IBM Z and LinuxONE around performance, security, cryptography, reliability, and scale.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-applications">IBM Cloud Pak for Applications</a>: Red Hat and IBM runtimes to build, deploy, and run</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>cloud-native applications. It includes Red Hat Runtimes (JBoss EAP, JBoss Web Servers, RedHat Data Grid, Red Hat Single Sign-On, OpenJ9, AMQ Broker &amp; cloud-native runtimes), Mobile First Foundation, WAS Liberty, Open Liberty, Open Liberty Spring, WAS Traditional, WAS ND among others.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/YBL2KLER">IBM Cloud Pak for Data</a>: Pre-integrated certified data and AI software to collect, organize, and analyze data for faster time to value. This initial release includes IBM Cloud Pak foundational services, IBM Db2 Management Console, and IBM Db2 Data Warehouse. Also available are IBM Db2 Advanced Enterprise Server Edition and IBM Db2 for z/OS Data Gate (beta version). Announcement information in this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/ibm-cloud-pak-for-data-on-ibm-z-accelerate-your-journey-to-cloud/">blog post</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-integration">IBM Cloud Pak for Integration</a>: Software to integrate applications, data, cloud services, and APIs, all efficiently connecting on IBM Z and LinuxONE. It includes MQ, Event Streams, Aspera HSTF Server, Cloud Integration Navigator among others.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-management">IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management</a>: Provides consistent visibility, automation, and governance across hybrid multi-cloud for IBM Z and LinuxONE. It includes IBM Multicloud Manager, Cloud Automation Manager (Terraform, Infrastructure Management), IBM Cloud App (iCAM) Monitoring Agents, Red Hat Ansible Tower/Engine/Automation, among others.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With these Cloud Pak offerings, you get a well-integrated set of building blocks not only to develop and operate your containerized applications securely but also to easily deploy anywhere, for example, when moving applications to IBM Z or LinuxONE.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On the z/OS operating system side of IBM Z, there’s the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/zos-cloud-broker">IBM z/OS Cloud Broker</a>, which allows OpenShift applications to interact with existing data and applications on z/OS. With this, developers can use z/OS resources without needing to have special skills.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And speaking of z/OS, we have to mention<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/wazi-developer">&nbsp;IBM Wazi Developer for Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces</a>, a containerized cloud-native development environment for z/OS running on OpenShift. You can continue to use the IDE of your choice, for example, Eclipse, Eclipse Che, or Visual Studio Code to develop and debug your COBOL and PL/I applications. We are also introducing version 15 of<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/developer-for-zos">&nbsp;IBM Developer for z/OS,</a>&nbsp;which is a toolset for developers on z/OS that includes COBOL, PL/I, High-Level Assembler, C/C++, JCL, and more tools.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And finally, to round it all up, to let you focus on app development IBM offers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/cloud-infrastructure-center">IBM Cloud Infrastructure Center</a>, which provides Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud management for your private, on-premises cloud environment for your choice of Linux distribution and OpenShift on IBM Z and LinuxONE.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It is clear that you can have the most secure and high-performance platform with IBM Z and LinuxONE. You can have a solid software infrastructure with fully supported Linux and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, and you have a large number of containerized products, tools, and runtimes ready to be used via Cloud Paks. Is that enough? There’s more. You can also check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/search?p=1&amp;architecture=s390x&amp;product_listings_names=Red%20Hat%20OpenShift%20Container%20Platform">Red Hat Container Catalog</a>&nbsp;of tested and verified container images available for IBM Z, LinuxONE, and OpenShift.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A final note</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>IBM and Red Hat have 25+ years of direct participation in open source, from Linux and compilers to AI, quantum, and blockchain. The IBM and Red Hat software mentioned on this blog is, for the most part, based on the innovation coming from open-source software. IBM is a world leader in open source participation, with active contributors in today’s most influential projects in the industry. Why is it important? IBM not only offers fully tested and supported products, with experts and open source contributors in key open-source projects, IBM provides leadership, influences the roadmap direction of open-source innovation, and provides highly differentiated, supported commercial offerings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
