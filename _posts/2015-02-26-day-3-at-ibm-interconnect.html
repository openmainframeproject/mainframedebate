<p>Day 3 at Interconnect was another fascinating day with a personal highlight...</p>
<p>The day started with a fantastic internal meeting where my long term mentor John Meehan got to tell the team about his expanded role focused on a wide breadth of the z software portfolio.</p>
<p>I then had lunch with the guys at <a href="http://www.comparethecloud.net">www.comparethecloud.net</a> I love working with these guys as they have a fantastic insight into the MSP space and always have a fresh approach.  I then had the opportunity to pitch on the Economics of New Workloads on the Mainframe to a conference audience and got some great feedback afterwards to IBM's message.</p>
<p>Then I joined what must have been 15,000 conference attendees in the evening for a concert by Aerosmith.  How Steve Tyler at aged 67 can run round the stage for 90-minutes is beyond me!!!! A particular highlight was when the band played my first dance song fro my wedding, and before you ask it wasn't "Dude Looks Like a Lady" it was their most romantic song of their set "I don't want too miss a thing"...  Another eclectic and amazing day at IBM InterConnect.</p>
