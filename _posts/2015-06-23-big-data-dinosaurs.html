<p>Big Data Dinosaurs</p>
<p>There are movies and then there is Jurassic World. Jurassic World is one of those outlandish, over-the-top Hollywood flicks that requires a health warning label before consuming. The movie is intense, jaw-dropping, and requires a tub of buttered popcorn and fizzling soda pop in order to be watched properly.</p>
<p>In the movie, Jurassic World scientists engineer a man-eating beast of a reptile, concocting up a version of what looks like Godzilla’s cousin and affectionately name him Indominus Rex.</p>
<p>Indominus eventually outsmarts his creators, escapes confinement, and wrecks havoc throughout the park. Indominus is almost impossible to contain, he attacks quickly, and he never rests. To be put it lightly, he’s a handful.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if Steven Spielberg was an infrastructure manager in a past life, but there are a lot of IT professionals who have their own Indominus Rex problem—and its name is Big Data.</p>
<p>Big Data has been clashing its teeth, sharpening its claws, and letting out its biggest roar, and the scariest part is it doesn’t plan on stopping anytime soon with 90% of the world’s data having been created in the past two years.</p>
<p>So what are we to do? Sharpen our existing spears? Hope it doesn’t eat our lunch…or us?</p>
<p>If there’s anything I’ve learned at wilderness camp or from watching Jurassic World, it’s to never turn your back on a predator, much less pretend it’s not there. Running from the Big Data problem is a mistake, and in this fight or flight scenario, it could mean the difference between carving out a competitive advantage or getting sliced and diced for breakfast.</p>
<p>So how do you defeat Big Data? How do you defeat Indominus Rex?</p>
<p>You fight them on your turf.</p>
<p>You bring the data in. You bring Indominus out of the forest and into the park.</p>
<p>By converging mission critical data onto one central platform you start playing with home field advantage. You reduce latency, improve response times, and boost performance across the entire architecture.</p>
<p>The z13 is a warrior armed with world-class memory, cache sizes, and improved I/O bandwith that serves up big data on a platter.</p>
<p>The Big Data Problem is growing and unlike Indominus Rex, it’s not going extinct anytime soon. When you’re battling Big Data, it helps to have infrastructure’s version of a T-Rex on your side—a Mainframe.</p>
<p>Editors Note: With Jurassic World number one in the box office the Editor would like to offer his timely thanks to a newbie on this site Grant Senter; who despite being still relatively new to IBM  has already captured the essence of the mainframe in this his inaugural post.</p>
