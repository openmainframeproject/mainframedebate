<p>We live in very interesting times. You can literally learn any skill for free on YouTube. We're also living in the golden age of Social Media. There are 3.6 billion active social media users worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Social Media and the Internet, with translational tools, have become the infrastructure that can deliver personalized solutions and services to people anywhere in the world. You can build an online business by getting people's attention through social media.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The question is what business? Below is an infographic by Anna Vital that shows start-up steps used by major online businesses.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>You decided on a business model, you built your prototype, you find a co-founder or two, and some investors to fund it.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now you have to decide which cloud vendor to use. The three major ones, AWS, Azure, and Google all have great services with lots of tools to get you up quickly and help you manage your online business. They make it easy to get started and inexpensive...at first.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Let's assume you choose AWS for your cloud company. They have a very strong ecosystem of software and a fairly reliable service. You launch your business, your social media marketing is starting to work and your users are coming. Your business is growing.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You have now entered The Death Trap -- "Vendor Lock In". The deeper you go in, the more difficult to escape.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>See the link below. This is what happed to Parler CEO John Matze.<br /><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/parler-what-happens-when-you-put-all-your-eggs-in-one-public-cloud-basket/?ftag=TRE-03-10aaa6b&amp;bhid=20703194569498883937149740924184&amp;mid=13232393&amp;cid=717464039" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.zdnet.com/article/parler-what-happens-when-you-put-all-your-eggs-in-one-public-cloud-basket/?ftag=TRE-03-10aaa6b&amp;bhid=20703194569498883937149740924184&amp;mid=13232393&amp;cid=717464039</a></p>

<p>AWS makes it very difficult and expensive to migrate off their service to another cloud vendor. When you use their applications, their tools, and their cloud management software. It takes months of planning, and sometimes years, to migrate off AWS. Because of vendor lock in, it's much more difficult than you think. Besides hosting services, AWS offers higher-level services, pre-configured databases, automatic video streaming, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Because of vendor lock in, John Matze was unable to move his business fast enough to avoid losing his customer base.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Remember, the public cloud vendors are&nbsp;not&nbsp;your friend. They are not a regulated industry. They can change their prices or terms, or force you off their platform at any time, for any reason.<br /><strong><br />A Better solution</strong><br />A much safer business decision is to avoid all proprietary cloud vendor software. Use only Open Source software and containers that are available on all cloud vendors. Then use at least two cloud vendors and balance your workload between them. Scale up when necessary and migrate workloads depending on operational requirements.<br /><strong><br />The Best Solution</strong><br />Once your business is stable and growing, install a scalable LinuxONE machine on prem or in a hosting center. You then have Total Control of your hosting solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br />AWS' key management is rated at FIPS 140-2 level 3 security rating. A LinuxONE machine is rated at FIPS 140-2 level 4. Why risk your business and your clients information by using a low security service?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong><br />Let's talk about cost. A rough rule of thumb is you'll spend about $100K per month per million active users for cloud services. Parler had 2.3 million active users and was spending $300K per month on AWS.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A LinuxONE machine in a private cloud on-premises or in a hosting center will reduce your hosting costs 40% to 80%. In a startup or a rapidly growing business, cashflow is critical. Save your money.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You can even host a LinuxONE machine in a closet (with proper power and cooling). Everyone has closets. Contact your LinuxONE sales team.</p>

<p>Don't become another victim of The Death Trap.</p>
