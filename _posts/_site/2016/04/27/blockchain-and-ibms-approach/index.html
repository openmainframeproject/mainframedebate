<p>Blockchain. If a particular word had double or triple points in buzz word bingo, it would definitely be blockchain. This year has brought increased attention to the ledger utilized by Bitcoin. Companies are expressing growing interest in the open source project and looking for ways to leverage this technology with existing processes and assets.</p>
<p>To briefly levelset blockchain, it is a system of a record for a business. A “block” is an executed and verified transaction. The “chain” is the ledger, a record for all transactions. Together, the blockchain is an electronic ledger. It is a decentralized and distributed ledger maintained by a network of peers. A peer is a computer which has a copy of the blockchain and the ability to verify the transactions. A block can only be added to the chain once its transaction is executed and verified by the peers. There are public blockchains and permissioned blockchains that allow for anonymity or privacy and increased levels of security depending on business requirements.</p>
<p>As interest has grown in blockchain, so have the offerings around it. One of the most notable for enterprise is the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org">Hyperledger project</a>. Hyperledger is a collaborative effort to advance blockchain technology for cross-industry open standards that can transform the way business transactions are conducted around the world. The project has many notable, innovative companies engaged. One of the premier partners, IBM, has been working to bring a greater understanding of blockchain to enterprises and helping them understand how it can be used in their processes.</p>
<p>IBM is peeling back the layers around blockchain at an event in New York City called, “Beyond the hype: Blockchain for Enterprise.” The event will take place on May 4, 2016, from 1 PM – 4 PM.
