<p class="entry-title">Today’s IT database infrastructure is shifting. New business requirements and the need to accommodate exponential growth in the amount and types of data require a new approach. Many companies are surrounding or replacing their traditional enterprise database (RDBMS) with new open source database management systems (OSDBMS) for more flexibility, speed and efficiency as they build new applications to address new business demands. According to <a href="http://info.enterprisedb.com/20150423-gartner-osdbms-report.html?src=2015gosdbms-edb-home-slide">Gartner</a>, more than 70 percent of new in-house applications will be developed on an OSDBMS by 2018, and 50 percent of existing commercial RDBMSs will be on the way to leveraging open source technology. Consider the following business needs:</p>

<p><strong>Analysing a wide range of data types and sources</strong></p>
<p>As businesses grow and adjust their plans to support a digital economy, their critical business data needs to adapt with them. Document databases are ideal for pulling data from various sources. A great example is MongoDB. With the rich feature set, scalability and flexibility of the MongoDB database, you can process the data of any structure. Optimised for LinuxONE, MongoDB  offers more than 2x better performance than x86. LinuxONE and MongoDB make an ideal solution for clients who are looking to deploy quickly, deliver on business commitments around availability and uptime, increase security and reduce cost. One example is the scale up nature of LinuxONE, MongoDB at scale typically means embracing the overheads associated with sharding the database across multiple hundreds or thousands of servers.  With LinuxONE you can grow the database on one single server, in fact in our labs we saw 470K read/writes per second in a 2TB single instance. This combination creates an ideal enterprise database-as-a-service platform.</p>
<p><strong>Driving efficiency with database infrastructure</strong><br />
Many clients are turning to open source alternatives for relational databases to drive efficiency in the datacenter without reducing capabilities. Open source databases like PostgreSQL have come a long way. PostgreSQL is hardened for enterprises and provides significant savings in software licensing costs compared to incumbent database deployments. The LinuxONE architecture is optimised for databases like PostgreSQL, delivering more than 2x more performance on LinuxONE processors compared to x86.</p>
<p>As client needs change, LinuxONE is committed to ensuring our clients have the technology they need to effectively compete in their industry. LinuxONE since launch at LinuxCon in August of 2015 has grown exponentially, building a strong and growing open software ecosystem, providing solutions anchored by a server portfolio with options for large and small clients alike and tying this to unparalleled data capabilities, availability, security and performance. As organisations build new business solutions that benefit from the flexibility and economics of Linux while integrating new capabilities with current applications, LinuxONE is  there to support them. Optimized on LinuxONE, these new OSDBMSs deliver performance advantages to go along with their flexibility and efficiency whilst delivering on the most demanding security and availability requirements.</p>
