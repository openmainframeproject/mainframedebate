<p><strong>How a Twitter Chat Works</strong></p>
<p>This blog has its roots in a twitter chat that we used to run with the hashtag #mainframedebate but as a refresher a Twitter chat is an easy way to get involved in a discussion that can be about anything. The important part is to follow the specific hashtag for the event. You can do that natively in Twitter, on the <a href="https://www.crowdchat.net/ileadit">#ILeadIT CrowdChat landing page</a>, Hootsuite or any other platform of your choosing.</p>
<p>Once a question is posted by the host account, everyone following along in the “Twitterverse” can provide his or her answer in 140 characters or less. You do that by coordinating your answers with the questions. For example, question one will be tweeted with “Q1”. Your answer to that question will start with “A1”. That will continue through the course of the Twitter chat. Oh, and don’t forget to include the hashtag!</p>
<p>Remember, you only have a limited amount of characters, so make sure to be succinct and creative in your responses. To get the most out of a Twitter Chat, make sure to keep the conversation going by engaging with other participants by “liking” and “Retweeting” their answers with your personal comments. We’re all here to learn from each other.</p>
