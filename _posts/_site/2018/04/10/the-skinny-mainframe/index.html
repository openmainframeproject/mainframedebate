<p>The modern mainframe or z14 and now the ZR1 is positioned as the core of trusted digital experiences and operates in some of the largest and most demanding computing environments in the world. From the days of the System/360 in the mid-1960's through to the modern mainframe of the z14, the systems have been designed along four guiding principles of security, availability, performance and scalability. From banking, to retail, to healthcare, the modern mainframe is a platform for mission critical apps and blockchain – where fast data access, transactional scale, and the highest level of trust are required</p>
<p>The mainframe is designed to support thousands of virtual machines, has the ability to serve vast amounts of data, and provides real-time insight and scalable sub-second transactional capability. The mainframe provides privacy for transactions and sensitive data by employing a dedicated cryptographic coprocessor, the CP Assist for Cryptographic Function (CPACF), which delivers cryptographic and hashing capabilities in support of clear-key operations. Exclusive to CPACF is the protected key support which provides the speed of processor based cryptography while helping to keep sensitive keys private from applications and the operating system.</p>
<p>The mainframe instantaneously allocates resources to handle massive swings in data, users and transactions. It is designed to host large databases in memory without splitting data sets into shards, and increases performance by avoiding latency in accessing data. Get all of this in a highly optimized, maintainable footprint. The mainframe has the industry’s fastest commercially available processor at 5Ghz, on core and on chip cache, large memory and unique dedicated I/O processing. There’s no need to split or shard databases; the z14 can host a 17TB MongoDB database on a single system with 2.4x better throughput.</p>
<p>By keeping the main cores free to run multiple mixed workloads in parallel without slowing each other down, the mainframe gains up to 50% faster Java performance and supports up to 2M Docker containers. The z14 handles it all with up to 170 cores (equivalent to over 1,000 x86 cores) and hundreds of dedicated I/O processors.</p>
<p>Now you can get all of this in a 'skinny' form factor designed for the cloud datacenter!  Gone are the days, and long gone at that,  when a mainframe was a datacenter. Now you can have all the goodness of the mainframe platform in a an industry standard 19" rack form factor... what is stopping you... get one today... its as easy to buy as a skinny latte...</p>
