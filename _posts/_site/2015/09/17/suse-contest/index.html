<p>15th anniversary for SUSE on IBM z Systems: Join the Contest!</p>
<p>This year, SUSE is celebrating 15 years of Linux powering IBM <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System_z">mainframes</a>.  and, to commemorate this most auspicious occasion, there is a contest with a seriously fantastic grand prize: <strong>airfare, hotel and pass to SUSECon 2015 in Amsterdam</strong>!</p>
<p>SUSE has always had a special place in our hearts for the mainframe, beginning work with IBM and the Marist College on bringing Linux to them all the way back in 1999.  Finally, at the end of October 2000, we shipped the very first version (SUSE Linux Enterprise) – resulting in what is, in a very real sense, the first enterprise-class Linux distribution.</p>
<p>On to the contest!  The rules are simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post a picture (to Twitter, Google Plus or Facebook) of “SUSE on the Mainframe”.  This could be anything from a picture of a SUSE Chameleon plushie on top of a mainframe… to a drawing of a Chameleon digitally added to a picture of a mainframe.  Use your imagination!</li>
<li>Make sure to tag SUSE (“<a href="https://twitter.com/suse">@SUSE</a>” on Twitter, “<a href="https://plus.google.com/+SUSE/posts">+SUSE</a>” on Google+ and “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/SUSEWorldwide/">@SUSEWorldWide</a>” on Facebook) in your post.</li>
<li>Include the hashtag “#SUSEonMainframe” in your post.  This will make sure SUSE sees your entry.</li>
<li>Get your picture posted no later than October 15th in order to be eligible for the grand prize.</li>
<li>There are no limits on the number of times you can enter.</li>
<li>Winners will be announced at the SUSE.com blog at <a href="http://www.suse.com/communities/conversations">suse.com/communities/conversations</a>, as well as on Twitter, G+, Facebook and LinkedIn.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Prizes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grand Prize: SUSE will fly you to Amsterdam, put you up at a hotel and give you a complimentary pass to <a href="http://www.susecon.com/">SUSECon 2015</a>— taking place November 2nd through 6th.</li>
<li>2nd Place: A SUSE-branded, Samsung Galaxy tablet.</li>
<li>3rd Place Prize: A large, plush SUSE Chameleon.  These guys are big and always in high demand.</li>

<p>Remember: You’ve only got until October 15th to get those pictures in to be eligible for the grand prize!</p>
<p>Editors Note: Thanks to Meike from SUSE for the details. Personally I love working with the SUSE team, and my oldest daughter sleeps with a huge SUSE gecko given to me by the Uk team.  Meike can be reached at Meike.Chabowski@suse.de if you need more details.</p>
