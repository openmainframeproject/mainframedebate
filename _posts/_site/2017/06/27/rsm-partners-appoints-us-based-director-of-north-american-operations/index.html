<p>Typically I actively discourage my contributors from blatantly promoting their business on this site, but the guys at RSM Partners are such a vital part of the mainframe ecosystem that I wanted to post their <a href="https://www.rsmpartners.com//News_RSM-appoints-US-based-Director.html">press release</a> for the recent US expansion and give them some 'free publicity'...  Don't worry normal service will be resumed shortly...</p>
