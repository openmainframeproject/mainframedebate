<p>The Open Mainframe Project is intended to serve as a focal point for deployment and use of the Linux OS in a mainframe computing environment. The Project intends to increase collaboration across the mainframe community and to developed shared tool sets and resources. Furthermore, the Project seeks to involve the participation of academic institutions to assist in teaching and educating the mainframe Linux engineers and developers of tomorrow. Through our internship program, students can expand their knowledge of mainframe technology, while at the same time helping contribute to open source projects that will make it easier for these infrastructure applications to run on Linux on z Systems.</p>
<h2>The Mission of the Open Mainframe Project</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create an open source, technical community that industry and community participants may easily participate in and so that they may contribute to the creation of assets and materials that will benefit the development of Enterprise Grade characteristics of Linux such as:
<ul>
<li>High Availability and Disaster Recovery</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Reliability, Availability and Serviceability</li>
<li>Performance and Scalability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Include participation of leading members of the ecosystem, including end users, solution providers, application developers and systems administrators to ensure the Open Mainframe Project addresses the needs of the community.</li>
<li>Hosting the infrastructure for the open source project, establishing a neutral home for community meetings, events and collaborative discussions and providing structure around the business and technical governance of the project.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Internship Program</h2>
<p>Open Mainframe Project is accepting eight student interns during the summer of 2017 to work in the Open Mainframe Project development community. Each intern will work closely with a mentor for the duration of his/her internship. For a list of suggested intern development projects, please see our <a href="https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/openmainframeproject/tsc/projectplanning"> Project Ideas Page</a>. Internship development projects do not need to be limited to ideas on this wiki page. If you have a great idea for a development activity for Open Mainframe Project, you can submit the idea as part of your application and, if chosen, the Open Mainframe Project Internship Administrator will find a suitable mentor for you.</p>
<p>Each intern will work remotely from his/her location of choice. There is no physical work facility provided or required.</p>
<p>The Open Mainframe Project will also give the ability for each intern successfully completing the program to present their project at an industry conference. The Open Mainframe Project will provide a stipend for travel for each student. To help support the student for presenting, the project will provide professional resources and training to help build their presentation skills.</p>
