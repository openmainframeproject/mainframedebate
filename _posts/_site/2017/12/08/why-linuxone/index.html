<p>So you may or may not know about LinuxONE, but let me tell you why if you don’t, you should!  First, let me set the scene, you are a senior IT leader of a ‘born on the cloud’ company, these last few years have been a rollercoaster ride… you were in on the ground floor as the company launched. Your IT needs have exploded as the company ‘crossed the chasm’ and now you are managing a complex cloud environment that is as much work and effort as you remember on-premises IT used to be. 16- 20 hours a day, every day, every waking hour, and sometimes in those dark hours when sleep is replaced by the pressure --- You feel the pressure to do more.  Develop more. Innovate more. Deliver more.  Support the business more. More skills. More apps. More up time.   More, more, more...</p>
<p>In this growing digital economy, the business expects more from the IT function you steer.  Technology, business models, and client expectations are dynamic, continue to evolve, change and grow.   It seems the established model of today was yesterday’s stretch goal. And it’s already yesterday’s Harvard Business Review case study…</p>
<p>How in a world where the next cool app makes billionaires of your peers from college, can CTO’s keep our organizations on the cutting edge of technology? How can you hope to harness the world where code is crowd-sourced, developed in an open source community, and running the business the next day? Further, in a world of security breaches that can reduce a CTO's tenure to minutes,  can you build an IT infrastructure that is truly secure? And to scale without fail to meet the demands of literally anyone and everyone – all with mobile phones or devices with an app zeroed in your infrastructure?</p>
<p>So let’s pull this scene apart a bit further, you run a huge AWS, IBM Cloud or Azure environment, but it’s still pretty much 3-tier in nature.  Your IT landscape has web servers, applications servers and behind it all, the heart of it all the servers that hold the crown jewels of your operation, the database servers.  Those first two tiers are fine, they don’t give you sleepless nights, hey that is what the cloud was built for.  You can leverage the economics and flexibility of the cloud, Docker and Kubernetes drives the flexibility you need and if a box fails along the way, heck HA just happens…</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about that third tier, those database servers.  Whilst no-SQL databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra give you infinite flexibility and promise scale, you have concerns and those concerns manifest themselves in four areas; performance availability, security, and scale…</p>
<p>Performance – While 90% of your cloud infrastructure performs just fine. In order to scale the performance of the most crucial part of your IT landscape, your team spends a disproportionate amount of time tuning database parameters, searching the web for some Linux performance utility that can eek the last 10% out of your server, just to keep up with this week’s customer growth…</p>
<p>Availability – while containers are great for most things, when your customer database moves because yet another box fails, it holds everything up, transactions are halted, worse they may even be lost.  Again for 90% of your IT requirements, the cloud is great, but for the 10% of your IT landscape that just has to be up, you dream of a server that never fails, ever…</p>
<p>Security – So let’s get down to it: you get hacked, you get fired, it’s that simple.  Do you know of a CIO that survived more than 4-weeks after a major hack of their organisation?  Now nobody cares whether a web server or an application server gets hacked those are just the route to the crown jewels.  What matters is the customer database, that’s where the credit card, social security numbers and all the rest of the personal identifying information resides.  You need this layer to be secure, encrypted, tamperproof, locked down from both external hackers and those disgruntled employees who are out to hurt you…</p>
<p>Scale – Whilst horizontal scaling again works fine for most things, and sharding databases is becoming the norm, at scale it can become an issue.  You want to both scale and not give yourself more headaches.  For those ‘crown jewel’ environments you need to have faith that whatever growth you throw at your infrastructure it will handle it and not blink…</p>
<p>So against the backdrop of these 4 requirements for the most crucial 10% of your IT you are looking for a server that is designed to handle performance with ease, always be up, be secure and scale to whatever the business demands next.</p>
<p>This infrastructure option exists -- one built for speed AND scale, built to be secure and trusted, built to be open and flexible, built to never fail.  A platform called LinuxONE, that’s open by design, for the crowdsourced tomorrow, for the next big apps-- yours. Always on, always performing, always handling the scale of everyone, always at your back. For you, that’s less pressure, and more time for business and personal innovation and growth.</p>
