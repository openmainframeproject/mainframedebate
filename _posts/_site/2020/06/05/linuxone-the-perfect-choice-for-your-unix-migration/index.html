<p>Today’s IT organisations are still managing in-house infrastructure and applications while also being asked to manage ever-increasing business demands and deal with external challenges that a few months ago were not even on the radar oftentimes without additional resources. Many enterprises cannot meet the challenges ahead and are increasingly held back by inflexible legacy UNIX systems. IT teams need the cost savings, security, flexibility, and compatibility that Linux can offer in conjunction with the mission-critical capabilities of enterprise-level server architectures such as IBM’s LinuxONE.</p>
<p>The viability of the UNIX platform is declining, with vendors such as Oracle and HPE winding down their investments in UNIX systems and shifting focus toward Linux platforms. Even IBM the last vendor that sees UNIX as strategic and continues to invest has invested $34Bn to acquire Red Hat the market-leading Linux distribution. In addition, new technologies and applications are often not certified or tested for UNIX systems. For example, 82% of applications running on large public cloud platforms are running on Linux, according to InfoWorld. Even the owner and developer of Windows, Microsoft now sees more Linux deployed on its public cloud platform Azure than any other OS. Inside public, private, and hybrid cloud infrastructures, applications are being built to run natively on Linux systems. Therefore, it is easy to assume that for many vendors, clients, and cloud platforms Linux, not UNIX, will power technology innovation going forward.</p>
<p>If you are still running UNIX, it is past time to switch. <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Red Hat® Enterprise Linux</a>, the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform, provides the foundational layer and operational consistency for traditional and cloud-native applications across hybrid deployments. When combined with IBM LinuxONE servers Red Hat Enterprise Linux provides the perfect match of Open Source innovation and robust mission-critical compute performance, security, and availability.</p>
<p><strong>CONFIDENCE IN SECURITY AND STABILITY </strong></p>
<p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux was developed in cooperation with security-conscious partners — including <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/industries/financial" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">financial institutions</a> and defense contractors — with safeguards built in to maintain 99.999% uptime, combat intrusions, and reliably run mission-critical applications. It is hardened, certified, and backed by the industry-leading <a href="https://access.redhat.com/security/overview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Red Hat Product Security</a>, Support, and Engineering teams and the global open source community. Red Hat Enterprise Linux gives you security and auditing technologies - and rock-solid predictability - to ensure the right applications, processes, and services have access to only the necessary resources.</p>
<p>When you combine the proven strengths of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with IBM LinuxONE you get the perfect combination for mission-critical Linux deployments.  UNIX systems were typically bought decades ago to handle distributed workloads where mainframe qualities of service were needed at a smaller scale in a more open systems model.  These qualities of service are still required in a Linux architecture.  Clients place a premium on platforms that can deliver Performance, Availability, Security, and Scalability, and the design point for LinuxONE when it was launched in 2015 was to address these concerns.</p>
<p><strong>CONTROL THROUGH AUTOMATION </strong></p>
<p>The average organization spends 70% of its IT budget and untold amounts of staff time maintaining existing applications. Red Hat Enterprise Linux lets you take control of your day, spending less time reacting and more time delivering business value and cost efficiencies with fine-grained management controls as well as scaled-out automation across your datacenter.</p>
<p>As your journey to hybrid multi-cloud and cloud-native applications continues the deployment of containerized applications and composable architectures will become more crucial.  As the scale of your container-based deployment grows then having a platform that is cloud-native to the core and leverages the Open Shift Container Platform strengths will be key.  LinuxONE fully supports Open Shift and provides a robust architecture for mission-critical Kubernetes and Ansible workloads.</p>
<p><strong>CUSTOMER SUCCESS</strong></p>
<p>IT teams know they must deliver innovative products and solutions to keep their companies competitive while still controlling costs. That’s why more than 90% of Fortune 500 companies rely on Red Hat products and services.</p>
<p>Red Hat coupled with LinuxONE is a proven platform in sectors ranging from; weather forecasting, central government, Internet retailing to core banking deployments.  Whenever clients need the most robust, scalable and performant Linux server architecture they tend to choose LinuxONE.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As you look to migrate from legacy UNIX based applications to a more open-source, container-based, cloud-native architecture but still need the performance, availability, scalability, and security that was behind your original UNIX decision decades ago, LinuxONE is a clear choice.</p>
