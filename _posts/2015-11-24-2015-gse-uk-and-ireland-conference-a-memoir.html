<p>Also this year the <a href="https://ibm.biz/BdXNzq">GSE UK and Ireland Conference</a> took place in the pleasant settings of Whittlebury Hall near Northampton, specifically between the 3rd and 4th November.</p>
<p>It is basically a kind of Mainframe University or Forum reuniting specialists from IBM, Mainframe Customers, Partners, Vendors in the Mainframe Area and people generally interested or curious about this kind of technology that keeps setting many standards within the industry.</p>
<p>It combined general sessions (guest speakers are well known either within the Mainframe or wider Technology Area) with time-frames in which participants could choose specific topics to discuss together ranging from “New Technologies” to “Large Systems” just to cite a couple of examples from the 18 main topics listed in the <a href="https://ibm.biz/BdH2CT">website</a>.</p>
<p>During the breaks in-between sessions participants had a chance to network together discussing their opinions on latest trends the Technology is evolving into. The synergic effect was very evident in a great atmosphere.</p>
<p>The GSE Team organised and supervised the event with their high standards of quality of service and the Conference Coordinator Mark Wilson from <a href="http://www.rsmpartners.com">RSM Partners</a> was also very good in reuniting in a timely manner the various participants for a checkpoint together before the next stages of the Conference with his witty sense of humour as a welcome addition to his effective communication skills.</p>
<p>To me the GSE UK and Ireland Conference was a wonderful opportunity to meet in person many of the Colleagues, Customer-Contacts, Partners, Mainframe Enthusiasts, Young Resources and Individuals I remotely work with on a daily basis and whom I praised in a <a href="https://ibm.biz/ferrariandz">previous writing</a>.</p>
<p>The official Twitter-Hashtag for the Conference was “#gseconf” while the two main Hashtags for the Mainframe Technology that keeps so dynamically evolving in parallel with or ahead of the latest technological trends are “#mainframe” and “#ibmz”.</p>
