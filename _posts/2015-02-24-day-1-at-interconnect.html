<p>So... day one so far at Interconnect:</p>
<p>Meet for breakfast with the team at Redhat to discuss MSP models and OpenStack and how we grow the platform.  Then meet with the team at Compare the Cloud to discuss how MSP's can leverage the platform, then meet with a couple of clients about building service delivery models on top of the mainframe.  Then pitch to 45 people about the mainframe as a cloud platform. Watch your GM present on why Infrastructure Matters with an amazing interlude but the CEO of Radixx Ron Perri....</p>
<p>Then the day takes a turn for the bizarre, as I end up in some selfie madness with some bloggers...</p>
<p>On the plan for tonight is a meeting with the WW IBM MSP sales team and then dinner with some z buddies... busy first day...</p>
